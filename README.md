- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Setting up a Database on Vercel](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-database/)
- [Seeding a Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_seeding)

### What I Did:

1. **Cloned the Starter Repository**
   - Used the provided **GitHub template** and created a new repository from [https://github.com/atlas-jswank/atlas-cinema-guru](https://github.com/atlas-jswank/atlas-cinema-guru)
2. **Installed Dependencies**

   - Ran `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Ran the Development Server**

   - Started the local dev server using:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Opened `http://localhost:3000/` to verify that the starter template was working.

4. **Set Up the Database**
   - Created a **new PostgreSQL database** in Vercel.
   - Configured the **.env.local** file with the required database credentials:
     ```
     POSTGRES_URL=your_database_url
     POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=your_database_prisma_url
     POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=your_database_non_pooling_url
     POSTGRES_USER=your_user
     POSTGRES_HOST=your_host
     POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
     POSTGRES_DATABASE=your_database
     ```
   - Seeded the database by calling:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/api/seed
     ```
   - This created the required database tables and populated them with initial data.

### Result:

- Successfully set up the project and database.
- The starter template was running locally with seeded data.

## Task 1: Authentication & Layout

### Resources:

- [OAuth with GitHub](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github)
- [Get Session](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/session-management/get-session)
- [NextAuth.js Documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Next.js Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts)

### What I Did:

#### 1. Implemented GitHub Authentication

- Integrated **GitHub OAuth** using **NextAuth.js**, allowing users to log in via their **GitHub accounts**.
- Configured **GitHubProvider** in the authentication setup, using environment variables (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`).
- Ensured authentication state was available throughout the app by wrapping everything in `SessionProvider`.

#### 2. Created Authentication API Route

- Implemented `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` to handle authentication requests (login/logout) using NextAuth.js handlers.
- This route manages authentication flows securely and redirects users based on their session state.

#### 3. Restricted Access to Logged-in Users

- Configured authentication callbacks to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- Modified `auth.ts` to ensure that all pages require authentication before allowing access.

#### 4. Added Logged-in User Info in the Header

- Created `app/components/Header.tsx` to:
  - Display the logged-in user‚Äôs email address.
  - Include a log out button that securely logs users out.
  - Styled the header to match the Figma design.

#### 5. Built the Sidebar with Activity Feed

- Created `app/components/Dashboard.tsx` to:
  - Have a collapsed sidebar by default.
  - Expand on hover.
  - Contain links to Home, Favorites, and Watch Later.
  - Display a dynamically updated Activity Feed (which was fully implemented in Task 5).

#### 6. Updated App Layout Structure

- Modified `app/layout.tsx` to:
  - Include Header and DashboardSidebar for consistent navigation across all pages.
  - Ensure responsiveness so that the sidebar works correctly on both mobile and desktop.

### Result:

- Users can log in via GitHub and log out securely.
- Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page.
- The app now has a consistent layout that includes a header and sidebar.
- The sidebar is collapsed by default and expands when hovered over.
- The Activity Feed framework was set up (fully implemented in **Task 5**).

### Troubleshooting:

**Issue: "Invalid Provider" Error in NextAuth**

- Authentication initially failed due to missing `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Fixed by **adding values to `.env.local`** and restarting the dev server.

**Issue: Sidebar Not Expanding on Hover**

- The sidebar did not expand correctly.
- Fixed by **adjusting hover states** and **transition effects** in Tailwind CSS.

## Reflection

This project was a great challenge in expanding upon existing source code while ensuring the design matched the Figma layout. It deepened my understanding of when to use Next.js server components vs. client components, how to structure API calls efficiently, and how to integrate authentication, filtering, and dynamic updates seamlessly. Troubleshooting issues‚Äîfrom authentication errors to ensuring Tailwind styles maintained accessibility and responsiveness‚Äîhelped me refine my debugging process and overall proficiency. Each task strengthened my ability to translate designs into functional, user-friendly applications, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.

With love,
